# medical_costs_py
In this project, I will be organising and then analyzing data provided in a 'csv' file. This file contains thousands of medical insurance records. Upon visual analasis I can see that each row of data consists on a different person in the dataset. The seven columns are as follows: age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, region, charges.  First, I will export the data from this file and create a typical, or average, person model to get a sense of the majority in this set of data. In the second part I will create a class for this data with a constructor to a create instances based on these values. Upon creating this, I will apply methods to my class to compare each person instance to the average. Finally, I will figure out the affect of BMI on an individual's insurance cost.
