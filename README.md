# medical_costs_py
In this project, I will be organising and then analyzing data provided in a 'csv' file. This file contains thousands of medical insurance records. Upon visual analasis I can see that each row of data consists on a different person in the dataset. The seven columns are as follows: age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, region, charges.  First, I will export the data from this file and create a typical, or average, person model to get a sense of the majority in this set of data. In the second part I will create a class for this data with a constructor to a create instances based on these values. Upon creating this, I will apply methods to my class to compare each person instance to the average. Finally, I will figure out the affect of BMI on an individual's insurance cost.

Inside the .ipynb file, you will find a step-by-step analysis of the data structured clearly.

## The aim of this project
The aim of this project was simple. Supplied by codecademy.com on the data scientist career path module, this was provided to practice basic Python syntax I had learnt. As my first open project, there was no guidance and I was expected to come up with my own structure for the project and what I was looking to analyse.

#### What I showcased:
- object manipulation
- formatting strings
- list comprehention
- using dictionaries to store data
- extracting data from CSV filetypes
- creating classes and instantiating them
- creating methods 
- generating random content (from the random library)
- loops
- conditionals
- creating modualar and easy-to-read code
